\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:pmc-results}

This section presents comprehensive results for predicting memory consumption in seismic workloads based on their \ac{3D} input shapes.
We organize the findings into four main categories:
(i) memory and execution-time profiling,
(ii) model performance overview,
(iii) feature selection experiments,
and (iv) data reduction studies.
Each category reveals different facets of how shape parameters affect resource requirements, model behavior, and prediction robustness.
All code, scripts, and output files that underlie these analyses reside in the \texttt{experiment} directory of the project repository~\cite{delucca2025experiment2results}.

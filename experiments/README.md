### [`02-predicting-memory-consumption-from-input-shapes`](./02-predicting-memory-consumption-from-input-shapes)

**Objective**:
This experiment aims to predict the memory consumption of Python programs based on the input shape.
The goal is to develop a model that can predict the memory consumption of a Python program based on features extracted
from the input data.

**Key Questions**:

- What features are most relevant for predicting memory consumption?
- What models are best suited for predicting memory consumption?
- How accurate are the predictions made by the model?
- How does the model perform on unseen data?
- What are the limitations of the model?

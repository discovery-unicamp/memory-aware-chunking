1. [`01-measuring-memory-consumption-of-python-programs`](./01-measuring-memory-consumption-of-python-programs)

**Objective**:
This experiment investigates how Python programs consume memory under different conditions, focusing on improving
memory-aware chunking.
The goal is to validate individual components used in the Memory Consumption Measurement Experiment before full
execution.

**Key Questions**:

- How does Pythonâ€™s memory management behave under different execution environments?
- What measurement techniques provide the most reliable memory usage data?
- How does peak memory usage vary across different computational workloads?
- What discrepancies exist between internal (Python-level) and external (system-level) memory profiling methods?

    "- Run experiments with memory constraints to validate `M_peak` accuracy.\n",
    "- Ensure that measured peak memory usage reflects the actual minimum required memory."

    "By structuring the experiment this way, we ensure a clear separation between explanation, validation, and execution, making it easier to reason about the results while keeping the experiment reproducible and well-documented."
